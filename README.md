Program meant to stimulate investments with some factors:
- Estimated yearly perfomances from passive investments(%)
- Estimated yearly performances from trading/active investments(%)
- Salary ($)
- Monthly cost of life ($)
- Part of profits that we withdraw each month(%)
- Initial money in accounts (Bank/Investments/Trading)

The simulation keeps going month per month until the user wants to stop (write "stop"),
at each step he can do many actions like:
- Changing % of profits withdrew (write "withdraw")
- Transfering money from different accounts (Bank/Investments/Trading) (write "transfer")
- Go to next month (just press enter)

Details taken into account:
- Keeping track of Total Networth
- Keeping track of Total Invested Money
- Monthly performances for each account and overall
- Flat tax on the withdrawn money (including the automatically withdrawn one) when transfering from any other account but bank account (30%)
- Total of paid taxes
- Number of months past
- Cost of life is deduced from bank account each month

Details that could be added:
- Change % of income to invest automatically each month with commands and change how you share money between investments and trading.
- Add random events that happen to a controlled frequency which makes you lose money (to test strategy taking into account that you might have accidents)
- Change salary sometimes (promotions/new job)
- Change cost of life progressively (settling down + inflation)
- Randomly use historical indexes like S&P500's performances to get realistic performances (investment part only)
- Add a small interest on the bank account (around 3% per year) 
- Draw an ASCII graph representing overtime wealth and invested money at the end of simulation (have to figure out how to display)

This simulation aims to simulate how it would happen in real life and allows to choose how much to invest/trade
and allow to manage money each month to have a realistic image of what you can achieve financially.
If used with realistic perfomances, the maths are right.
